# FounderFocus CLI Toolkit

## Project Overview

This project is a command-line toolkit to help solo founders make data-driven startup decisions using real-world investment data. The toolkit performs startup analysis, calculates buzzword scores, categorizes funding stages, and identifies acquisition-ready startups.

## Files in This Repository

1. **`founder_focus.py`** - The Python module containing the `FounderFocus` class and related functions for analyzing startup data. It includes methods for:
   - Setting startup sector and funding.
   - Checking if a startup is acquisition-ready.
   - Generating summaries and exporting them to text and CSV formats.

2. **`founder_summary.txt`** - A summary report generated by the CLI for a sample startup. This file contains information about the startup's sector, funding, and whether it is acquisition-ready.

3. **`founder_data.csv`** - A CSV file containing startup data, including funding details. This is generated by the CLI tool and can be used for further analysis in spreadsheet software.

4. **`founder_focus_project.ipynb`** - The Jupyter Notebook used for the project. This file contains the code used to analyze startup data, run various calculations, and generate reports. It demonstrates the use of the `FounderFocus` class and its methods.

## How to Use

### **Run the Python module (`founder_focus.py`)**:

```bash
python founder_focus.py

This will run the CLI toolkit, analyze the data, and generate reports.

Use the Jupyter Notebook (founder_focus_project.ipynb):

Open the notebook and run the cells to see how the toolkit works in a step-by-step fashion.

The notebook includes code for generating a startup summary and CSV reports, which are saved as founder_summary.txt and founder_data.csv respectively.

Reports:

The founder_summary.txt file will contain a textual summary of the analyzed startup, including its sector, funding, and acquisition-readiness status.

The founder_data.csv file will contain structured data about the startup, such as its name, sector, funding, and whether it’s acquisition-ready.

Notes

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the code.

For further customization, feel free to modify the code in the founder_focus.py module.

The founder_focus_project.ipynb notebook is useful for understanding and modifying the data analysis flow.
